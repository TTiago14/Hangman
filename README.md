# Hangman

# Introduction
* Hangman is a simple game where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's body is drawn until the player either guesses the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn, resulting in a loss.

# Features
* Custom word input: You can input a word or phrase for your friend to guess.
* Random word selection: If you don't want to choose a word, the game will select one randomly from a predefined word list.
* Visual hangman: A graphical representation of the hangman's gallows and body parts as incorrect guesses are made.
* Error checking: The game validates input to ensure that only single alphabetic characters are accepted as guesses.
* Win/loss tracking: The game keeps track of wins and losses and displays the results at the end of each game.
